Grace hash join cost

rR = 1000,  bR = 50,  rS = 3000,  bS = 150,  cRes = 30

N = 43

h(x) = x % 5

partitioning R = 50 reads + ~50 writes  ... 5 partitions, each with ~10 pages
partitioning S = 150 reads + ~150 writes ... 5 partitions, each with ~30 pages

Prob join phase using 40-page hash table

read each R partition into in-memory hash table
for each R partition scan corresponding partition of S

Cost = 3*(bR + bS) = 3*(~50 + ~150) = ~600
